## Ancient Game of Nimm

Nimm is an ancient game of strategy that is named after the old German word for "take." It is also called Tiouk Tiouk in West Africa and Tsynshidzi in China.

### How to play: 
- The game starts with a pile of 20 stones between the players.
- The two players alternate turns taking stones until there are zero left.
- On a given turn, a player may take either 1 or 2 stone from the center pile.
- The two players continue until the center pile has run out of stones.
- The last player to take a stone loses.

## Here's a sample execution:

_There are 20 stones left

Player 1 would you like to remove 1 or 2 stones? 2

There are 18 stones left

Player 2 would you like to remove 1 or 2 stones? 2

etc...

There are 2 stones left

Player 1 would you like to remove 1 or 2 stones? 1

There are 1 stones left

Player 2 would you like to remove 1 or 2 stones? 1
